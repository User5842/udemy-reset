# udemy-reset

There are times when I revisit an old Udemy course, and I want a way to reset my progress.

There's no automated way to accomplish it, so I am forced to go through hundreds of checkboxes to untick completed lessons.

This extension helps with that ðŸ˜€

## Installation

[Udemy Reset on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/udemy-reset/gekcecelcbhmapkiepahomgbhddjeile)

## Instructions

1. Navigate to a course on Udemy that you already have some progress on.
2. Ensure that the **Course Content** panel is open (it's okay if you're on the mobile or desktop view).
3. Click on the Reset Progress button on the extension popup.
4. You'll see a slight animation (it's user feedback to let you know it's working!), and the panels will expand and then close, leaving your progress at 0.
5. Enjoy the fresh start!
