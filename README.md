# udemy-reset

There are times when I revisit an old Udemy course, and I want a way to reset my progress.

There's no automated way to accomplish it, so I am forced to go through hundreds of checkboxes to untick completed lessons.

This extension helps with that ðŸ˜€

## Instructions

1. Navigate to a course on Udemy that you already have some progress on.
2. Ensure that the **Course Content** panel is open (it's okay if you're on the mobile or desktop view).
3. Click on the Reset Progress button on the extension popup.
4. You'll see a slight animation (it's user feedback to let you know it's working!), and the panels will expand and then close, leaving your progress at 0.
5. Enjoy the fresh start!

## Okay, so how do I use it?

The extension is currently going through the review process at the Google Chrome Store, so it might take some time before it's published. However, if you want, you can give it a shot today by downloading the most recent ZIP file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qx6d9omchh7i0kz/udemy-reset.zip?dl=0), then:

1. On a Chromium-based browser (such as Edge or Chrome), navigate to chrome://extensions.
2. Ensure that `Developer mode` is enabled.
3. Click on `Load unpacked.`
4. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
5. Reset your progress!
